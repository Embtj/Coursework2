                Former Air Force pilot and intelligence agent Carol Danvers pursued her dream of space exploration as a
                NASA employee,
                but her life forever changed when she was accidentally transformed into a human-Kree hybrid with
                extraordinary powers.
                Now, Carol is the latest warrior to embrace the mantle of Captain Marvel, and she has taken her place
                as one of the world’s mightiest heroes.

                <h2 class="story-heading">Story</h2>
                <p>
                    As a NASA security officer, Carol investigated numerous attempts made by the Kree and Skrulls to
                    infiltrate Kennedy Space Center and disrupt
                    America’s space program. During a battle between the heroic Mar-Vell and his rival, Yon-Rogg, Carol
                    was
                    exposed to the Psyche-Magnitron,
                    a Kree device that could make imagination into reality. Carol subconsciously envied Mar-Vell’s
                    powers,
                    and the machine responded to those desires
                    by rewriting her DNA to make her a human/Kree hybrid with abilities similar to his.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carol took on the identity of Ms. Marvel and even fought alongside Mar-Vell/Captain Marvel and the
                    Avengers. Her early career was cut short when Rogue,
                    a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, attacked Carol and permanently drained her powers and
                    memories. It took years for Carol to recover from her
                    ordeal, but she finally achieved her dream of space exploration and traveled far from Earth. Carol
                    even
                    became cosmically empowered and took on the
                    codename Binary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Binary powers faded over time, leaving Carol with most of her original abilities. Carol
                    returned to
                    Earth and rejoined the Avengers. Years later,
                    Carol adopted the codename Captain Marvel as a tribute to her fallen friend and mentor. Her
                    prominence
                    has also grown exponentially, and Captain Marvel
                    is now the most popular heroine in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carol Danvers was already in excellent shape before she was transformed by the Psyche-Magnitron.
                    Afterwards, Carol’s body was pushed to the peak of human
                    fitness and modified with Kree DNA. Her powers include enhanced strength, stamina, agility, and
                    durability, as well as flight, and almost total immunity to
                    toxins and poisons. Carol also has a “seventh sense” which gives her precognitive flashes of the
                    future, but the power randomly manifests and has largely faded away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Binary, Carol’s connection to the power of a white hole allows her to generate and control any
                    form
                    of radiation or gravity, as well as the ability to survive and travel
                    in space without the protection of a spacesuit. Although the vast majority of Carol’s Binary powers
                    have been lost, she still retains the ability to absorb energy and fire
                    photonic blasts from her hands. If Carol is exposed to enough energy, her full Binary powers have
                    the
                    potential to temporarily reemerge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michael Rossi is Carol Danvers’ first mentor, and later, her lover. But, he was also secretly
                    working
                    with a terrorist named Ghazi Rashid, who captured
                    and tortured Carol during a covert mission. Years later, Rossi admitted he was grooming Carol to be
                    his
                    mole for the Air Force Special Operations.
                    Rossi also betrayed Carol to Norman Osborn and delivered her to Rashid, after he had been enhanced
                    with
                    powers of his own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a heroine, many of Carol’s deadliest foes are of Kree origin, including Ronan the Accuser, the
                    Supreme Intelligence, Yon-Rogg, Doctor Minerva, and Doctor Eve.
                    Deathbird of the Shi'ar has been a constant nemesis for Carol, but Mystique, M.O.D.O.K., and
                    Moonstone
                    also have a long history with her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Immortus’ son, Marcus, struck at Carol with his warped sense of love, as he brainwashed her and
                    made
                    Carol love him after abducting her to Limbo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carol also has very good reasons to hate Rogue. Before she joins the X-Men, Rogue accidentally
                    drains
                    Carol of her powers and memories. Since Rogue has
                    redeemed herself as a heroine, Carol’s stance towards her has softened. They even teamed up during
                    the
                    Avengers’ war with the X-Men, but Carol may never
                    fully forgive Rogue for violating her so deeply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During her espionage days, Carol befriends Wolverine, Nick Fury, and Ben Grimm (the Thing). She
                    eventually aligns herself with the Agent (Rick Mason),
                    although they are initially on opposite sides. Since adopting her original Ms. Marvel identity,
                    Carol
                    has become close friends with Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew),
                    Jessica Jones, and Wonder Man, as well as other members of the Avengers. Carol is also an
                    inspiration
                    for the current Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Carol is in charge of Operation: Lightning Storm, she takes Spider-Girl/Araña (Anya Corazon)
                    under
                    her wing and accepts Machine Man as her teammate. Carol also
                    joins the Starjammers, Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ultimates, and A-Force, while forging close
                    connections with them as well. At one point, Carol also has
                    a romantic relationship with War Machine (James Rhodes), but their time is cut short by his tragic
                    demise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More recently, Carol serves as commander of the Alpha Flight space station with Abigail Brand and
                    three
                    original Alpha Flight members: Aurora, Puck, and
                    Sasquatch. Additionally, Carol adopts a cat named Chewie, which is actually a Flerken, an alien
                    species
                    that resembles felines from Earth. A young Kree
                    girl nicknamed Bean has also earned her place in Carol’s heart. Carol feels very protective towards
                    Bean, and she even traveled to an alternate universe
                    to bring her home safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When she was a young girl, Carol Danvers dreamed of becoming an astronaut and exploring the cosmos.
                    However, Carol’s aspirations for higher education
                    were thwarted by her father, who chose to send her younger brother, Steve, to college instead of
                    her.
                    Despite the setback, Carol graduated from high
                    school at the top of her class and enlisted in the United States Air Force when she turned
                    eighteen.
                    Once again, Carol excelled and quickly rose through
                    the ranks as one of the Air Force’s top pilots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During a reconnaissance mission over Afghanistan, Carol’s plane was shot down by insurgents led by
                    Ghazi Rashid. Carol suffered a broken leg in the crash,
                    and she was subsequently captured and tortured by Rashid and his men. Amazingly, Carol not only
                    managed
                    to escape, but she killed most of her captors as well.
                    Air Force Special Operations officer Michael Rossi debriefed Carol, and was so impressed by her
                    that he
                    recruited her into Special Operations and began training
                    her as a spy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Carol embarked on her new path, Michael became her mentor and her lover. She also crossed paths
                    with
                    Nick Fury, as well as Ben Grimm and Logan (James Howlett).
                    Eventually, Carol left the spy world behind to pursue her original passion at NASA. She became the
                    head
                    of security at the Kennedy Space Center, where she met
                    Dr. Walter Lawson, a man who was secretly the Kree spy known as Mar-Vell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mar-Vell became very close to Carol, and he developed a kinship for humanity while acting to
                    protect
                    the Earth. He was soon called Captain Marvel by the public and
                    recognized as a hero. As both the Kree and the Skrulls attempted to infiltrate NASA, Carol
                    investigated
                    Mar-Vell’s human identity before she was captured by his Kree rival,
                    Yon-Rogg. In the subsequent battle between Mar-Vell and Yon-Rogg, Carol was knocked into a Kree
                    device
                    called the Psyche-Magnitron. Somehow, the machine dramatically altered
                    Carol’s DNA by making her half-Kree and giving her powers similar to Mar-Vell’s superhuman
                    abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carol’s career at NASA was devastated by the ongoing incursions and attacks. After being demoted
                    well
                    below her original position, Carol angrily resigned and wrote a
                    tell-all book about her experiences. It quickly became a best-seller and opened the door for her
                    new
                    writing career. However, Carol’s life was complicated by the
                    Psyche-Magnitron’s changes to her mind and body. She developed a split personality who went into
                    action
                    as Ms. Marvel, with a costume that resembled Mar-Vell’s outfit.
                    Carol had no memory of her activities as Ms. Marvel, and she was alarmed by her blackouts and her
                    missing time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the next few months, Carol became aware of her alter-ego, but her two personalities remained
                    distinct and separate. That changed in the aftermath of a Kree attack,
                    with a mind-altering device which backfired and unified Carol’s two personas. Now truly a new
                    woman,
                    Carol embraced her role as Ms. Marvel and rapidly became a prominent
                    heroine. Carol was even invited to join the Avengers, which she readily accepted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carol proved to be a formidable addition to the Avengers’ ranks, and she developed friendships with
                    teammates Wonder Man and Scarlet Witch. Meanwhile, the mutant criminal
                    Mystique became one of Carol’s personal adversaries when she murdered one of her close friends,
                    Michael
                    Barnett. Carol’s life took a turn for the worse when she was
                    kidnapped and abducted to the realm known as Limbo. Carol’s captor was a man named Marcus, who
                    claimed
                    to be the son of Immortus, an enemy of the Avengers.
                    Marcus brainwashed Carol into loving him, and then returned her to Earth where she would give birth
                    to
                    a new physical body for Marcus himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once back with the Avengers, Carol had no memory of what occurred in Limbo and she was
                    understandably
                    alarmed by her sudden pregnancy and delivery. Marcus grew to adulthood
                    within a matter of days and explained who he was and what had happened. Even after the truth was
                    revealed, the Avengers allowed Carol to accompany Marcus back to Limbo.
                    However, Marcus was unable to stop his accelerated aging and he soon died. Once again in command of
                    her
                    own mind, Carol found a way to escape Limbo and returned to Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carol had quietly resumed her role as Ms. Marvel in San Francisco when she was attacked by Rogue,
                    Mystique’s adopted daughter and a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Rogue’s assault was
                    vicious, but even she didn’t foresee the outcome of their encounter. Rogue’s powers of absorption
                    spiraled out of control and permanently stole Carol’s memories and her powers. In a haze, Rogue
                    attempted to murder Carol, but her life was saved by Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the efforts of X-Men founder Charles Xavier, Carol emerged from her coma with some of her
                    memories, but none of the emotional bonds that came with them. She also angrily berated the
                    Avengers
                    for not seeing through Marcus’ lies when he took her back to Limbo. Bereft of her powers, Carol
                    remained with the X-Men for a time and even briefly encountered Rogue during a mission to erase the
                    government’s files on Xavier’s team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the X-Men were captured by the alien Brood, Carol was experimented on due to her unique
                    genetic
                    structure. Somehow, they connected Carol to a white hole, and she emerged more powerful than ever
                    before. Now calling herself Binary, Carol used her newfound energy abilities to help the X-Men
                    defeat
                    their mutual enemies. Once she arrived back on Earth, Carol was hit with the devastating news that
                    Mar-Vell had died from cancer. Soon after, Carol felt betrayed when Xavier allowed Rogue to join
                    the
                    X-Men to help her deal with the overwhelming memories and persona she had absorbed from Carol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Deciding to leave Earth behind, Carol joined the Starjammers in space as they attempted to
                    reinstall
                    Lilandra Neramani as the leader of the Shi'ar. Carol remained with the Starjammers even after
                    Lilandra
                    was restored as Empress, but she was also drawn into the Kree-Shi'ar War and the Avengers’
                    Operation:
                    Galactic Storm. Carol used her Binary powers to save Earth’s sun from a Kree plot, and nearly
                    burned
                    herself out in the process. Carol remained on Earth to recuperate, and she even briefly regained
                    her
                    lost memories and emotions during an encounter with the Stranger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once many of Earth’s heroes returned from the Onslaught incident, Carol was among the new
                    incarnation
                    of the Avengers. She reclaimed the second costume she’d worn as Ms. Marvel, though she changed her
                    codename to Warbird. However, Carol hid her greatly diminished powers from the rest of the team and
                    began drinking heavily. Eventually, Carol’s bad decisions caught up with her and she was
                    court-martialed by the team. Carol angrily quit the Avengers before they could discipline or help
                    her,
                    and she relocated to Seattle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While settling into her new life, Carol’s writing career took off again. Her alcoholism also
                    spiraled
                    out of control, and she even attacked Iron Man when he attempted to help. During that conflict,
                    Carol
                    nearly crashed a passenger jet by recklessly throwing Iron Man into it. Together, the two heroes
                    saved
                    the plane, and Carol subsequently turned herself into the authorities while accepting full
                    responsibility for her actions. As part of her suspended sentence, Carol was told to rejoin the
                    Avengers and continue her treatment with Alcoholics Anonymous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now fully in command of her faculties, Carol flourished with the Avengers. She became an
                    instrumental
                    member of the team when it became a global strike force. However, Carol was shaken during Kang’s
                    invasion by his son, Marcus, a.k.a. the Scarlet Centurion. This was not the same Marcus who had
                    violated Carol years before, but Carol found the physical similarity between the two men to be
                    extremely unnerving. It didn’t help that this Marcus was instantly attracted to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marcus was so enamored with Carol that he actually helped her seize control of the Master of the
                    World’s defense systems even though it was in direct opposition of Kang’s plans. For that betrayal,
                    Kang eventually killed his son. Following Kang’s defeat, Carol demanded that the Avengers hold her
                    accountable for killing the Master during her assault on his base. However, they quickly cleared
                    her of
                    any wrongdoing. Shortly thereafter, Carol was recruited for a prominent position in the Department
                    of
                    Homeland Security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite believing the DHS to be the best use of her powers and skills, Carol quickly grew
                    disenchanted
                    with the organization and the political games it entailed. During the House of M incident, Carol
                    experienced a world where she was Earth’s most popular heroine as Captain Marvel. When reality was
                    returned to normal, Carol retained her memories of that alternate life and resolved to redefine
                    herself
                    as a heroine. She subsequently quit the DHS and resumed her Ms. Marvel identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Months later, Carol was drawn into the first Super Hero Civil War on Iron Man’s side as a prominent
                    supporter of the Superhuman Registration Act. Working closely with S.H.I.E.L.D., Carol formed her
                    own
                    team, Operation: Lightning Storm, and she was also named the leader of a new group of Avengers.
                    During
                    this time, Carol also became romantically involved with Wonder Man. However, Carol’s powers were
                    slowly
                    becoming unstable, and she was unprepared for the Skrull invasion that nearly conquered the Earth.
                    In
                    the aftermath, Tony Stark was ousted from S.H.I.E.L.D. while Norman Osborn assumed control of
                    H.A.M.M.E.R. and his own team of Avengers. Carol resigned from the Avengers in protest and joined
                    Luke
                    Cage’s renegade team of Avengers. In the midst of this, Osborn had Moonstone begin wearing one of
                    Carol’s original costumes, while calling herself Ms. Marvel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Osborn took a personal interest in destroying Carol, and he discovered her history with Rossi and
                    Rashid. Osborn recruited Rossi to his side and gave Rashid superhuman abilities before goading
                    Carol
                    into a fight that would claim her life. Carol was able to defeat Rashid in battle, but her unstable
                    powers caused her body to explode and she was thought to be dead. In reality, Carol’s energies
                    reformed
                    as two different people: Ms. Marvel and Catherine Donovan, a successful writer who was free from
                    her
                    responsibilities as a heroine. Subsequently, Carol’s two halves were once again merged, and she
                    soundly
                    defeated Moonstone in a battle for control of her legacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the fall of Osborn, Carol was once again an Avenger. During the Avengers’ war with the X-Men,
                    Carol was sent on a mission to space where she encountered Mar-Vell, who had been resurrected by a
                    Kree
                    Minister who utilized a portion of the Phoenix Force. While Mar-Vell and Carol briefly fell under
                    the
                    Minister’s sway, she resisted his control and Mar-Vell once again sacrificed his life for his
                    people.
                    Moved by Mar-Vell’s actions, Carol took the Captain Marvel codename as a tribute and she adopted a
                    brand-new costume as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Captain Marvel, Carol’s status among her fellow heroes grew exponentially. But her rise was not
                    without a cost. Carol discovered that she had a brain lesion which threatened to destroy her
                    memories
                    if she used her powers to fly. At the same time, Yon-Rogg resurfaced and stole a piece of the
                    Psyche-Magnitron that Carol had kept as a keepsake. Yon-Rogg used the Psyche-Magnitron to empower
                    himself and utilized its connection to Carol’s brain to form a Kree city over New York City. To
                    disrupt
                    the plan and save the city, Carol flew into orbit and suffered massive brain damage. Her internal
                    injuries were subsequently healed but her personal memories were lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adrift and no longer sure who she was, Carol joined the Guardians of the Galaxy for new adventures
                    in
                    outer space. When she returned to Earth, Carol joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in the hunt for the Illuminati
                    as
                    the multiverse faced its imminent destruction. Carol also became romantically involved with War
                    Machine
                    (James Rhodes) before the Avengers came to an uneasy truce with the Illuminati. The short-lived
                    armistice wasn’t enough to save reality, but Carol was among a handful of heroes to take shelter in
                    a
                    specially made ship designed to survive the end of everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Secret Wars that followed, Carol found herself as a prisoner of Mister Sinister in his
                    realm
                    on Battleworld. Although Carol was experimented on and tortured, she subsequently turned the tables
                    on
                    Sinister and convinced him to go against the God Emperor, Doctor Doom. Carol also took part in the
                    final battle, which led to the restoration of the multiverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the newly rebuilt reality, Carol was busier than ever. She co-founded A-Force, a team of
                    all-female
                    Avengers; joined the Ultimates, a Super Hero team designed to tackle the impossible problems; and
                    she
                    became the commander of the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station, Earth’s first line of defense
                    against
                    alien invasions. Subsequently, Carol became obsessed with a young Inhuman known as Ulysses, and his
                    power to predict the future with a high degree of accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following Ulysses’ warning about Thanos, Carol gathered a team of heroes to face the Mad Titan.
                    Although they managed to subdue and capture Thanos, the battle claimed the life of her lover, James
                    Rhodes, and left She-Hulk in a coma. Rhodes’ death enraged Tony Stark and set the stage for the
                    second Super Hero Civil War. Carol emerged as the leader of a large faction of heroes who favored
                    using
                    Ulysses’ powers to prevent disasters and crimes from occurring, while Stark rebelled against it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The heroes were once again torn apart by conflict, and Stark was rendered comatose during his final
                    battle with Carol. Ulysses subsequently ascended to a higher level of existence, while Carol became
                    the most popular heroine on Earth, with a fictional television series based on her life. While
                    dealing
                    with refugees from the destroyed Kree home world, Hala, Carol befriended a young Kree girl,
                    nicknaming
                    her Bean. A Kree scientist known as Doctor Eve inserted herself into Carol’s life as a psychiatrist
                    and
                    used Bean’s effect on Carol to disrupt her powers. While saving Bean from Eve’s experiment, the
                    young girl became a being of pure energy and disappeared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Carol was so distracted by her other issues that she was completely blindsided by Captain America
                    when he engineered a Hydra coup and seized control of the Earth for his Secret Empire while leaving
                    Carol and Alpha Flight locked out of the planet. To complicate things even further, Carol and her
                    forces
                    had to fight off a seemingly unending wave of Chitauri. Eventually, the real Cap emerged to take on
                    his
                    Hydra doppelganger. But the Alpha Flight station was destroyed during the conflict, essentially
                    grounding Carol on Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon after, Carol received a cryptic message from Bean that led her to follow the child and Dr. Eve
                    into a parallel universe, where she discovered the Reality Stone of her universe had been hidden
                    away.
                    Dr. Eve convinced Bean that it was her destiny to use the Reality Stone to transport the Hala from
                    the
                    parallel universe to her original universe. Fortunately, Carol was able to make Bean see reason,
                    and
                    they returned to the prime universe together with the Reality Stone in tow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As forces gathered the Infinity Stones together, Carol was once again drawn into an intergalactic
                    conflict. Back on Earth, Carol was invited to rejoin the Avengers alongside Captain America, Iron
                    Man,
                    Thor, She-Hulk, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes).
