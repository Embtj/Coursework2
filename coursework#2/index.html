                            with extraordinary powers.
                            Now, Carol is the latest warrior to embrace the mantle of Captain Marvel, and she has taken

                            field agent, Carter never backs down and never surrenders to enemies of the state.
                            Whether a covert operative of S.H.I.E.L.D. or helping the Avengers with communications
                            support, she’s always fighting to protect others and would gladly give up her life for
                            freedom. Born into a wealthy Virginia family, Margaret “Peggy” Carter joined the resistance
                            fighters
                            in Nazi-occupied France during World War II, leaving her comfortable American life behind.
                            Becoming one of the resistance movement’s bravest and most skillful fighters, Peggy
                            operated under the codename Agent 13, AKA Mademoiselle.</a>

                            wisdom of “With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!
                            High school student and child prodigy Peter Parker submerged himself in his passion for
                            science to avoid the taunts and threats of his fellow classmates and stumbled into a world
                            beyond his imagining. While visiting a public exhibition of new breakthroughs in radiation
                            manipulation and genetics, Parker felt the bite of a common house spider exposed to a
                            particle beam and felt immediately ill from it, little realizing how much his life would
                            change in the coming hours.</a>
